# REST-CRUD-EMPLOYEE
A Spring Boot REST API for managing employees using a layered architecture — controller handles HTTP requests, service manages business logic, and DAO handles database operations via JPA. The `Employee` entity maps to a database table, supporting full CRUD plus partial updates via PATCH.
